This is a repository of the apps that and I have worked on. The apps were previously in the Play Store, but were removed once the businesses closed their doors.

## Rithmio EDGE

The Rithmio gesture recognition algorithm was used within an Android+Smartwatch application.  This app was used by weightlifters and fitness enthusiasts to determine which exercise they were doing and count the reps for them.

## Rithmio Cadence Counter

In preparation for the Rio 2016 Olympics, Rithmio partnered with the Paralympics team at The University of Illinois.  We developed an Android+Smartwatch App that allowed the paralympic athletes to see their stroke cadence and displayed information about their movement on the app.
